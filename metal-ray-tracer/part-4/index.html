**Going slightly physically based**

In the previous parts we've implemented diffuse and rough conductor materials. 
Now we going to add a two materials - plastic and dielectric. Also we going to 
make sure that our materials are physically correct (or at least plausible).

[Source Code](http://github.com/sergeyreznik/metal-ray-tracer/tree/part-4)
for this post is available on my GitHub page. Additionally, I've created a 
[repository](https://github.com/sergeyreznik/raytracing-references) with scenes that were used to 
validate ray-tracer.

Easy way to validate results
================================================================================
Before implementing a new materials, we need to figure out a way to make sure that our materials are 
physically correct. In the previous posts I compared images produced by ray-tracer with those produced by Mitsuba. 
But such comparison gives nothing but visual similarity, and while rendering could be 
incorrect it still will be visually similar to the correct one. Therefore, if we want to compare images against Mitsuba
we need to develop a more robust way to do it. 

I propose a simple method, which will be able to quickly provide an information about luminance 
in the images, and compare it to the reference image produced by Mitsuba (or PBRT if you want). Take a look at this two images:

![](images/pic-1.png)![](images/pic-2.png)

They look almost identical and what is important they both looks natural. It is hard to notice that glass box is 
slightly different (I intentionally modified Fresnel term), especially when comparing final image to the reference. 

So lets make a simple comparison method: get the average value from red, green and blue components of
 each pixel of source image and reference and find the difference between two averaged values. If difference is greater than zero 
 - it means that image produced by our ray-tracer is brighter than reference and vice versa. So lets output this 
 difference to the green channel if is is greater than zero and negative difference to the red channel if it is smaller than zero:
<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Obj-C
float colorLum = dot(color.xyz, 1.0f / 3.0f);
float referenceLum = dot(referenceColor.xyz, 1.0f / 3.0f);
float diff = (colorLum - referenceLum) * COMPARE_SCALE;
color = (diff > 0.0f) ? 
    float4(0.0f, diff, 0.0f, 1.0f) :
    float4(-diff, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</script>

Ideally we would see a black color if we matched the reference perfectly. But in the real world there a several factors 
that won't allow us to see a perfect zero difference:
- number of samples are usually limited, which leads to noise;
- .exr format (to which Mitsuba and PBRT can save results) stores data as half floats (16 bits), which introduces rounding errors.

This mean that when we implemented everything correctly we will likely be seeing a red-green noise on the image. 

Compare the difference images below. These are difference between images above and the reference image:

![](images/pic-3.png)![](images/pic-4.png)

Note the glass box: on the first image we can see an almost uniform red-green noise, 
while on the second image glass box has noticeable darker (reddish) sides. Tall box are brighter on the bost images, this will be explained below, 
when we will implement plastic BRDF.

This is very rough methon of estimate a similarity to the reference, but it gives results almost immediately.

Furnace test
================================================================================
Another (and actually more proper) way to validate materials is so called "Furnace test". The name comes from a property of a furnace in thermal equilibrium. 
When a furnace reaches equilibrium, its interior has a completely uniform appearance, causing all geometric features to disappear [^](http://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/global-illumination-path-tracing/global-illumination-path-tracing-practical-implementation).
Idea behind it is to put a white object, (which does not absorbs light) usually a sphere, to the environment having uniform color. 
If BRDF is implemented correctly (i.e have energy conservation property) then the object will have color of the environment - 
it will not absorb light and will not emit any additional light. Usually it is good to make a gray environment, in this way it would be easier to notice 
energy gain.

Take a look on these three images:

![](images/pic-5.png)![](images/pic-6.png)![](images/pic-7.png)

The first one - is the correct plastic BRDF implementation. In the second one BRDF was not multiplied by cosine between normal and outgoing ray direction,
the third one does not accont for Fresnel in diffuse component and probability distribution function.

So now we have a least two methods to verify our BSDFs, so let's implement plastic and dielectric materials.

Plastic BRDF
================================================================================
Let's add a plastic BRDF

Glass BSDF
================================================================================
Let's add a glass BSDF

Unbiased rendering
================================================================================
Probability of terminating a path
