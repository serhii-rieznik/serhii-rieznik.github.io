**Metal ray-tracer**
    
In this series of posts I'm going to describe ray-tracer implementation
using [Metal Performance Shaders](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders).
Apple already have [ray-tracing demo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing)
but we will start from the scratch and implement more physically correct ray-tracer
with next event estimation, multiple importance sampling, spectral rendering and maybe something else :)

Before the start
================================================================================
I'm assuming a reader is familiar with development for macOS (or iOS),
so I will skip trivial things like creating a project, using Objective-C, etc.
But make sure you have at least:
- macOS Mojave (10.14) or later
- Xcode 10 or later
These could be either downloaded from
[Apple's developer web-site](http://developer.apple.com/download/) or updated
via macOS App Store as soon as Apple release them.

Also **I'm strongly adivising you** to read some very useful books and resource on
ray-tracing and computer graphics:
- [Physically Based Rendering](https://pbrt.org)
- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend series](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html)
- [The Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com)

In our ray-tracer demo project we will be using third-party **libraries**:
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader)
They will be added to the [source code](https://github.com/sergeyreznik/metal-ray-tracer/)
for this blog post series as submodules.

Tracing our first triangle
================================================================================
In [this post](part-1/index.html) I will describe how to setup environment for
our ray-tracer and trace one hard-coded triangle.
