**Writing ray-tracer using Metal Performance Shaders**
    
In this series of posts I'm going to describe ray-tracer implementation
using [Metal Performance Shaders](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders).
Apple already have [ray-tracing demo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing)
but we will start from scratch and implement a more physically correct ray-tracer
with next event estimation, multiple importance sampling, spectral rendering and maybe something else :)

Before the start
=======================================================================================
I'm assuming a reader is familiar with development for macOS (or iOS),
so I will skip trivial things like creating a project, using Objective-C, etc.
But make sure you have at least:
- macOS Mojave (10.14) or later
- Xcode 10 or later
These could be either downloaded from
[Apple's developer web-site](http://developer.apple.com/download/) or updated
via macOS App Store as soon as Apple release them.

Also **I'm strongly advising you** to read some very useful books and resource on
ray-tracing and computer graphics:
- [Physically Based Rendering](https://pbrt.org), which recently become [available online](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html) for free
- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend series](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html)
- [The Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com)

In our ray-tracer demo project we will be using third-party **libraries**:
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader)
They will be added to the [source code](https://github.com/sergeyreznik/metal-ray-tracer/)
for this blog post series as submodules.

Tracing our first triangle
=======================================================================================
In [this post](part-1/index.html) I will describe how to setup an environment for
our ray-tracer and trace one hard-coded triangle.

Tracing some geometry
================================================================================
In [this post](part-2/index.html) we will load and trace geometry from a file,
prepare an environment for path tracing, and implement simple diffuse BRDF with
next event estimation.

Extending the ray-tracer
=======================================================================================
Adding multiple bounces
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In [this post](part-3-1/index.html) we will add multiple light bounces to our ray-tracer.

Improving material system and adding multiple importance sampling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In [this post](part-3-2/index.html) we will rewrite our material system to be able to extend ray-tracer
with new materials. Also we will implement multiple importance sampling.
